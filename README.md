# memory_game

A new Flutter project.

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! ðŸŽ®

I've developed a Memory Game using Flutter, where users match identical shapes. Each game features dynamic card positions to ensure a unique experience every time! ðŸŒŸ

âœ¨ Key Features:

- Dynamic card shuffling for endless fun
- Real-time score tracking
- Animated and user-friendly interface
- A restart button & game completion time display

This game is perfect for children, helping them improve their memory skills while having fun. Stay tuned for a more challenging version coming soon! ðŸš€

Check out the demo and let me know what you think! ðŸš€ #Flutter #GameDevelopment #MobileApp #MemoryGame #TechInnovation
